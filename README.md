# 📘 Teach2Give Attachment Journal
A day-by-day documentation of my 3-month software engineering attachment at Teach2Give.

This repo includes:

✅ Weekly breakdowns of what I learned (Week 1 to Week 12)

🛠️ Side projects and personal initiatives during the attachment

📚 Notes, code snippets, and reflections to track my growth

This journal serves as both a learning log and a portfolio of progress.
