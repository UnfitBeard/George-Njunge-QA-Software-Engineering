Week 6 has been a very interesting week full of learning opportunities.

1. Agile and Scrum Methodologies
First we got to have a coaching session with a scrum master after we had a communication skills session involving scrum terminologies.
I learnt alot about agile methodologies and scrum. 
I got to ask a lot of questions about how a scrum master operates and how they should handle various challenges.
Thanks to @UnfitBeard for sharing the knowledge.

2. Technical stuff
This week we dug deeper into backend using typescript, express and postgres.
This is what we learnt this week:
    1.Controllers, Middlewares and Routes in express.
    2.JWT token for authorization
    3.Authorizations Guards for APIs
    4.AsyncHandlers and debugging.

3.Tasks completed
After thorough learning we Implemented an End to End API with auth guards. We then integrated the functionality into the Library Management System I had been building. 
The system has the following new functionalities.
    1. When a user logs in they are assigned an access and a refresh token.
    2. The token contains the user_role as defined in the users table and roles table.
    3.A user depending on whether they are admin, a Librarian or a Borrower can be able to access various functionalities using the token e.g a Borrower cannot be able to add or delete books. They are blocked by the guards inside middlewares from accessing those functionalities.
    4.A user can also log out which resets the access_tokens and refresh tokens.

As I continue with my learning journey, things continue to get tougher and so am I. Am looking forward to learn more and do more to build my knowledge. Much appreciations to our trainer @Alamin Juma for his dedication. Also I would like to mention my group members @Naff Mwaura, @kefah, @Cynti and @Oyogi Oberi for their insights and knowledge.
