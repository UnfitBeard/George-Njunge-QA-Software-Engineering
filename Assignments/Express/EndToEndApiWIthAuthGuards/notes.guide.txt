Another week down, we keep grinding👷.
This week was intense and the workload was hefty but I mananged to come out with my chin up.
💪
It was all about the backend- diving deep intoNode.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL.
🚀 What I Learned:
    ✅ Creating a server using Express.js and Node.js
    ✅ Middleware & Routes for handling requests efficiently
    ✅ PostgreSQL basics for managing data
    ✅ Using the  .POST method to add data to the database
                  .GET method to fetch the data,
                  .PUT method to Update entire records, 
                  .PATCH method to Update fields, 
                  .DELETE method to delete an entire record
    ✅ Entity Relationships (my last one was toxic… jk lol 😆)

🛠 Hands-on Work:
➡️We used this knowledge to serve our data by creating an API that fetched data from the frontend.
➡️Initially, the server was using the readFileSync() command to read the data from the JSON file.
➡️Then we learnt how to implement the sorting logic from the backend using Query Parameters.
➡️Next was setting up a PostgreSQL database where we stored our data.
➡️We proceeded to learn some few postgreSQL Queries for basic CRUD operations i.e Create, Read, Update, Delete.

🔥How I implemeted the newly acquired skills
This enabled me to implement the following on the books app:
 ✔ Connect my server to the database using pg-pool(method for connecting to postgreSQL)
 ✔ Implement CRUD operations for the data.
 ✔ Using Postman to test my APIs,including best methods like creating collections and environments
 ✔ Implement the sorting and filtering algorithms from the server side.
All in all it was a week packed with learning and building.Here's to next week🚀
