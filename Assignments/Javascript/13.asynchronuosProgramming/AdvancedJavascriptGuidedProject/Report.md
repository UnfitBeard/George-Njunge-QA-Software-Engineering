🚀 The past few weeks have been a great learning experience.
👷 I have worked on various projects that have helped me sharpen my coding skills.
📈 The journey has been full of ups and downs—a crazy learning curve—but my confidence levels are increasing every day. Thanks to my trainer, Alamin Juma, for his dedication.
📖 This week, we learned about callbacks, async/await, event loops, promises, and how to avoid the "Pyramid of Doom."

This enabled me to complete a book library project, which fetches JSON data using an API and displays it on an interface.
The interface has the following functionalities:

    Filtering based on genre
    Sorting based on title (ascending or descending), book pages, and year of publication
    Adding items to the cart when you click the purchase button
    Opening a modal populated with the items in the cart

⏩ I also learned TypeScript fundamentals, including the various type annotations.
I'm excited about diving deeper into TypeScript and building more projects!
