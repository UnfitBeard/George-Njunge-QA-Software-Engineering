🚀 Week 7 Progress at TEACH2GIVE: Diving into Angular & TypeORM!
This week has been really exciting as we started learning Angular! On Monday, we explored a brief introduction to Angular, focusing on its features, advantages, Shadow DOM, and scalability.

📚 Learning Highlights
✅ 1️⃣ Data Binding – A way of communication between components and HTML.
🔹 Types of data binding:
    String Interpolation
    Property Binding
    Two-Way Binding
✅ 2️⃣ Directives – Used to manipulate the DOM, such as adding/removing elements, styling, or modifying behavior.
🔹 Examples: ng-if, ng-for, ng-switch, ng-style, and ng-class.
🔹 We also learned about ng-template, which conditionally displays content.

✅ 3️⃣ Component Communication & Pipes
🔹 Passing Data: Child-to-Parent communication in Angular.
🔹 Event Emitters: Used to transmit data between components.
🔹 Pipes & Data Transformations: Formatting data for display.

✅ 4️⃣ Services & Dependency Injection
🔹 Dependency Injection: Managing class instances efficiently.
🔹 Lifecycle of a Component: Understanding Angular’s component lifecycle.
🔹 State Management: Basics of using services for managing state.

✅ 5️⃣ ORMs
🔹 TypeORM: Learning how to interact with databases using TypeORM.

👷 Building & Implementation
💻 Library Management System:
✅ Implemented the registration and login controller (function) using TypeORM.

📝 To-Do App in Angular:
✅ Built a To-Do app and successfully used TypeORM to add data to a database.
