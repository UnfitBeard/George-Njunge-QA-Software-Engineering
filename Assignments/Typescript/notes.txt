ðŸ˜¬what a tough week its been. 
This week was all about Typescript and Testing. 
Its only week four but we keep grinding as we have unresolved promisesðŸ˜ƒ.
We delved in to the following topics that have helped me grasp most if 
not all there is to know about typescript
   1. Type Annotations â€“ Explicitly specify the type of variables, function parameters, or return values to catch errors at compile time.
   2. Union Literals and Narrowing â€“ Allow variables to hold multiple specific values, with TypeScript refining types based on conditions.
   3. Objects (Interfaces, Extending, Intersections) â€“ Define structured objects, extend existing types, or merge multiple types for flexibility.
   4. Mutability â€“ Determines whether a variable or object property can be modified, with readonly preventing changes.
   5. Classes â€“ Provide object-oriented programming features like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
   6. Generics â€“ Create reusable, type-safe functions, classes, or interfaces by using type placeholders.

I also learnt how to do unit testing using jest. 
That was one of my few Ws this week.
I had to redo the books Library App using typescript.
It was very challenging as at first.
I had pasted the whole JS code to a TS file not knowing that
the amount of errors generated would almost bully my confidence.
I started coding from scratch again so that I could deal with the errors 
one by one. I came to understand why they were appearing
 and that really helped 
me understand the various types of errors and how to solve them.
